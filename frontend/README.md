# IdeaDog - Front-End

The front-end of IdeaDog, built using React, with TypeScript, bootstrapped with Next.js.

## Features :open_mouth:

Ooh, you're checking out the sneak peek of IdeaDog's upcoming revamp! This branch is an active work-in-progress. I am currently hard at work in the process of:

- Converting the app onto server-side rendering with Next.js.
- Converting authorization process into magic link sign in.
- Moving authorization logic onto server with Express.
- Reorganizing global state management with Redux & Redux Thunk.
- Design overhaul.

## Usage :running:

If you would like to run this work-in-progress locally, first you'll need:

- Node.js
- Yarn or NPM

Then, to set the up front-end React environment:

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install --network-timeout 500000`

   - _Network timeout must be increased to permit `@material-ui/icons` sufficient time to download._

2. Run the development server: `yarn dev`
3. Accessible at `http://localhost:1234`
