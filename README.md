## NOTE ON IDEADOG DEVELOPMENT :dog:

Note that the current state of this repo and project will soon be outdated - I am currently hard, hard at work at completely revamping the front-end of IdeaDog. And I mean completely revamping. I am in the process of:

- Converting the app onto server-side rendering with Next.js.
- Converting authorization process into magic link sign in.
- Moving authorization logic onto server with Express.
- Reorganizing global state management with Redux & Redux Thunk.
- Design overhaul.

If you would like a sneak peek at the code behind this revamp, you can check out [this branch](https://github.com/bdbaraban/ideadog/tree/nextjs/frontend).

Stay tuned, there are some big-time updates in the works for IdeaDog. - Brennan

## Description :bulb:

IdeaDog is a social media web application for sharing ideas.

We have all had those moments, those sudden bursts of inspiration where we think - "wow, that is simply a _great_ idea" - but know we will never follow up. Now, instead of losing those ideas, share them with the world!

### Why statically-typed?

Our kind of question.

The front-end of IdeaDog is built in React, with TypeScript, while the back-end runs on Rust. In our book, TypeScript + Rust = The Ultimate Statically-Typed Web App!

### I have a great idea! Where can I post it?

IdeaDog is currently deployed at [ideadog.site](https://ideadog.site) - please do check it out!

#### NOTE

Note that authorization is currently buggy. If you attempt to log in/sign up, you will need to refresh the page twice upon verification for your account to register. Read the development note above for news on coming fixes ^^^.

## Medium Blog Posts :newspaper:

## Authentication :key:

</p>

Passwords are no fun. IdeaDog features a passwordless user authentication process managed by [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). The process works as follows:

1. User enters email (for login) or both email + username (for signup). Front-end initially sends email/username to back-end.

   1. If logging in, and an account does not exist with the given email, back-end returns a redirect code, and user is directed to sign-up.
   2. Otherwise, back-end generates and returns a challenge token associated with the email.

2. Front-end temporarily stores challenge token in `localStorage`, then uses the Auth0 API to send a login email to the user. The login email includes a random code that user must enter to verify account.

3. Upon entering the verfication code, the user is redirected to the home page of IdeaDog. The redirect occurs on a URL hashed by Auth0 which the front-end parses to retrieve the user's Auth0 profile.

4. Front-end pulls up challenge token from `localStorage` and returns it to the back-end with the verified email. Back-end generates and returns a bearer token in the form of a cookie.

   1. After being returned to the back-end, the challenge token is cleared from `localStorage`.

5. The bearer token has been set and the user can fully acccess their profile!
